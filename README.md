# Virus-Contact-Tracing-System
First project  in 'System Progrramming' course.

In the spirit of the COVID-19, this is a contact tracing system.

The program simulates corona virus spreading, while having contact tracers looking for infected nodes and trying to disconnect their connections.

Output: Graph of the connections after the infection and the infected nodes.
How to operate:
1) Make sure bin folder is empty
2) make
3) bin/cTrace config1 (or 2/3/4)
4) Check output.json file to see the result of the simulation.
